# CPEN291-Gotham-Deliver-Service
## A fullstack project for UBC-CPEN-291(2021/2022) built as a team of 4 students.
## Implemented with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.JS, MicroPython and Lego Ev3.

I setted up the NodeJs backend and deployed it onto a VM provided by UBC, built the UI of the ordering and status pages. 
The ordeing page is built with pure client side JS and the status page involves Ajax by fetching data from a JSON file.
