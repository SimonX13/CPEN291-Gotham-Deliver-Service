    <p id="small-info">
        Our team decides to make a lego robot car out of CV6. Through brainstorming, our group finds doing a
        delivery system model would be
        a novel idea. We will use logo robot car as our delivery car. In addition, we will make our own maps
        to simulate a real map. This website
        is used to show all details about the lego car, as well as allowing user to input the delivery they
        want. We will in total have 7 houses
        with different color. The lego robot will follow a specific path and deliver the package to the
        corrosponding color.
